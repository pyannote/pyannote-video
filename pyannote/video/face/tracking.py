    Parameters
    ----------

        Path of the MTCNN detector model
    detect_min_size : float, optional
        Approximate size (in video height ratio) of the smallest face that
        should be detected. Defaults to any face.
    detect_every : float, optional
        When provided, face detection is applied every `detect_every` seconds.
        Defaults to processing every frame.
    track_min_confidence : float, optional
        Kill trackers whose confidence goes below this value. Defaults to 10.
    track_min_overlap_ratio : float, optional
        Do not associate trackers and detections if their overlap ratio goes
        below this value. Defaults to 0.3.
    track_max_gap : float, optional
        Bridge gaps with duration shorter than this value.
